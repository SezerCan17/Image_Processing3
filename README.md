Modified Contrast Adjustment Method
This project outlines a modified contrast adjustment method applied to an image, analyzing results for various (slow, shigh) percentages.

The code converts the image to grayscale, computes histogram equalization parameters (slow, shigh), and adjusts pixel values accordingly.

Visualizations compare results for different parameter values, and time complexity is evaluated as O(f(n)).
